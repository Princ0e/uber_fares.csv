# ðŸš– **Uber Fare Data Analysis Report**

## **1. Introduction: Project Overview and Objectives**

This project aims to analyze historical Uber fare data to understand patterns in pricing, identify anomalies, and derive insights that can support better pricing strategies, demand forecasting, and route optimization. The dataset includes ride details such as pickup and drop-off coordinates, fare amounts, and timestamps. The goal is to perform thorough data cleaning, apply feature engineering techniques, and extract valuable patterns and correlations from the data.

## **2. Methodology: Data Collection and Analysis Approach**

- **Data Source**: The dataset `uber.csv` was provided as a CSV file, containing trip-level data for Uber rides.  
- **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook (or script).  
- **Steps Taken**:
  1. Loaded and examined the raw dataset.
  2. Dropped missing and invalid records (e.g., NaN, out-of-range coordinates).
  3. Converted datetime columns and extracted useful time features (hour, weekday, etc.).
  4. Computed trip distances using the Haversine formula.
  5. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
  6. Identified outliers using IQR for fare amount.
  7. Visualized relationships between fare and other factors.

## **3. Analysis: Detailed Findings and Statistical Insights**

- **Missing Data**: The dataset initially contained missing values. After dropping these rows, the clean dataset had fewer entries but was more reliable for analysis.  
- **Fare Amount**:
  - Outliers were detected beyond the IQR bounds.
  - Majority of rides had fare amounts between \$5 and \$20.
- **Temporal Patterns**:
  - Most rides occurred during **morning (7â€“9 AM)** and **evening (5â€“8 PM)** hours, showing clear **peak periods**.
  - Fare amounts slightly increased during peak hours.
- **Distance Calculation**:
  - Distances were calculated using the Haversine formula, and rides with unrealistic distances (0 or >100 km) were excluded.
  - A positive correlation was found between fare amount and distance, as expected.
- **Heatmap Correlation**:
  - Moderate positive correlation between `distance_km` and `fare_amount`.
  - Weak or no correlation with day, month, or weekday.

## **4. Results: Key Discoveries and Pattern Identification**

- **Peak Ride Times**: The data shows high demand during traditional commuting hours, confirming peak travel patterns.  
- **Outliers in Fare**: Detected and visualized outliers that may indicate pricing errors or special ride conditions.  
- **Fare vs Distance**: A clear upward trend confirms distance is a strong predictor of fare price.  
- **Temporal Impact**: Hour of day impacts fare more than day of the week or month.

## **5. Conclusion: Summary of Main Findings**

The analysis successfully cleaned and transformed raw Uber fare data into meaningful insights. We confirmed that ride fares are most influenced by trip distance and time of day. Outliers exist in the data and need careful treatment. Feature engineering such as distance calculation and time extraction was key in unlocking these insights.

## **6. Recommendations: Data-Driven Business Suggestions**

1. **Dynamic Pricing Strategy**  
   Implement fare adjustments based on demand during peak hours.

2. **Fraud Detection**  
   Use outlier detection to flag suspiciously high or low fares for further review.

3. **Optimized Driver Deployment**  
   Allocate more drivers to areas/times with high predicted demand using hourly trends.

4. **Improved Fare Estimations**  
   Incorporate `distance_km` and `hour` into fare prediction models to increase accuracy.

5. **Data Quality Monitoring**  
   Set up automatic filters for invalid coordinates and distances to maintain clean datasets for real-time analytics.
